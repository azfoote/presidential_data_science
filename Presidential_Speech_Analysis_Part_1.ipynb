    "These presidents were chosen for several reasons.  They are all contemporaries of each other, and thus theoretically wrote speeches using similar language patterns.  The fact that they peformed these speeches more than 200 years ago adds an extra layer of challenge, as many of the phrases and words chosen are not commonly found in modern written communication.  Lastly, though they were all Founding Fathers, their levels of education, political philosophy, and temperaments were all very different. I will ultimately try to see if I can predict which of the founding fathers wrote a given sentance.  But first there is data collection and pre-processing to do.\n",

    "Lastly for the word count column, I will calculate the non-parametric skew for word counts per sentence written by each president.  The non-parametric skew is a measure of the positive or negative skew of the underlying distribuiton, where a skew of 0 indicates that the distribution is symetrical.  It can be calculated by the formula (mean-median)/std"
